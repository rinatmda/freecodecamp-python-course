# Demographic Data Analyzer

This project is a solution to the **Demographic Data Analyzer** project from FreeCodeCamp's 
[Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer) course.

The project analyzes demographic data from the 1994 Census database using Python and Pandas. 

> Note: This project uses starter code provided by freeCodeCamp. The main task was to implement the function `calculate_demographic_data()` in `demographic_data_analyzer.py` to perform the required analysis. Unit tests were used to verify the solution.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to answer several questions about the dataset, including:

- How many people of each race are represented  
- The average age of men  
- Percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree  
- Salary statistics based on education level  
- Minimum working hours and high-earning percentages  
- Country with the highest percentage of people earning >50K  
- Most popular occupation for high earners in India  

All calculations are done in `demographic_data_analyzer.py` using Pandas. Unit tests are provided in `test_module.py`.

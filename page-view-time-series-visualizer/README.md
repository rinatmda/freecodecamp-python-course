# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is a solution to the **Page View Time Series Visualizer** project from FreeCodeCamp’s  
[Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer) course.

The project analyzes time series data of daily page views on the freeCodeCamp forum using Python and common data analysis libraries. It was completed starting from the provided starter code, with all core analysis and visualizations implemented by the author.

## Project Overview

The project analyzes daily page views of the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03 to explore trends and seasonal patterns.  

Key tasks included:

- Importing and cleaning the data (`fcc-forum-pageviews.csv`), removing outliers from the top and bottom 2.5% of values  
- Drawing a **line plot** of daily page views  
- Drawing a **bar chart** of average monthly page views grouped by year  
- Drawing **box plots** to visualize yearly trends and monthly seasonality  

All visualizations were implemented using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

# Sea Level Predictor

This project analyzes historical global average sea level data (1880–2014) and applies linear regression to estimate sea level rise through 2050. The project was completed as part of freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/) course.

> Note: Starter code and tests were provided by freeCodeCamp.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore long-term trends in global sea level rise and compare:
- the overall historical trend (1880–2014)
- the more recent trend observed since 2000

The results are visualized using scatter plots and lines of best fit extended to 2050.

## Key Insights

- Global average sea level has been steadily increasing since 1880.
- The rate of sea level rise since 2000 is significantly higher than the long-term historical average.
- Linear extrapolation shows noticeably higher projected sea level by 2050 if the recent rate of sea level rise continues.
- The analysis is based on simple linear models and is intended for exploratory purposes.

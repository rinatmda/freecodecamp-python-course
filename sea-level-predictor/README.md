# Sea Level Predictor

This project is a solution to the **Sea Level Predictor** project from freeCodeCamp's  
[Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/) course.

The project analyzes global average sea level data from 1880 to 2014 using Python and Pandas.  

> Note: This project uses starter code provided by freeCodeCamp.

## Project Overview

The project analyzes **global average sea level data** from 1880 to 2014 to:

- Explore historical trends in sea level rise  
- Predict future sea level in 2050 based on the overall trend  
- Predict future sea level in 2050 based on the trend since 2000  
- Visualize results using scatter plots and lines of best fit with proper labels and titles  

Unit tests are provided in `test_module.py` to verify the solution.

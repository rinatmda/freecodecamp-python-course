# Medical Data Visualizer

This project is a solution to the **Medical Data Visualizer** project from freeCodeCamp's 
[Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer) course.  
It was completed starting from the provided starter code, with all core analysis and visualizations implemented by the author.

## What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed raw medical data (height, weight, blood pressure, lifestyle factors)
- Engineered features (BMI categories, risk indicators)
- Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
  - Categorical bar plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
- Ensured all automated tests pass
